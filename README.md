CraftNukkit
===========

* Basically CraftBukkit with stuff
* Will only be updated to CraftBukkit Beta and Recommended Builds

Yet Another Fork of CraftBukkit
-------------------------------
I'm doing this mainly for me. I like Spigot but **IN MY OPINION**:

* it's a bit unstable, it doesn't crash often, but it still crashed at least once in 2 months
* it has too many things/features in it that I don't need
* the only real advantage it has over CraftBukkit is the integrated Orebfuscator

I decided to just make my own simple fork. I don't know what I will add to it.
There's no plan, and there's no support. CraftNukkit is under GPLv3.
